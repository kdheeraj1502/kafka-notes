for cluster configuration

dataDir=/tmp/zookeeper-1 is defined in zookeeper config file

go to the same folder in your computer , its present at rool package, does do 

cd .. on terminal unless you reach at the root package, there you will find volatile folder temp , which gets removed on computer starting up


now in above folder create myid with value 1 then in dataDir=/tmp/zookeeper-2 with 2 and then in dataDir=/tmp/zookeeper-3 with value 3
command is 

echo "1" > myid
echo "2" > myid
echo "3" > myid


Kafka Commands

download zookeeper, copy it 2 create 3 zookeeper installation folder name them apache-zookeeper-3.8.3-bin_1, apache-zookeeper-3.8.3-bin_1, apache-zookeeper-3.8.3-bin_1

// i downloaded apache-zookeeper-3.8.3-bin as a installation and appended 1 , 2 , 3 to create 3 copies, similary for kakfa,
kafka_2.13-3.3.1_1, kafka_2.13-3.3.1_2, kafka_2.13-3.3.1_3
in conf folder of each add below configuration, same in all 3

All same in all 3


there is server.properties in same folder ::
i just changed the ports such as 
9092, 9093 and 9094

below i copied from 9094 wala, 3rd wala kafka ka configuration

# See kafka.server.KafkaConfig for additional details and defaults
#

############################# Server Basics #############################

# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.
broker.id=3

############################# Socket Server Settings #############################

# The address the socket server listens on. If not configured, the host name will be equal to the value of
# java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName(), with PLAINTEXT listener name, and port 9092.
#   FORMAT:
#     listeners = listener_name://host_name:port
#   EXAMPLE:
#     listeners = PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092
#listeners=PLAINTEXT://:9092

# Listener name, hostname and port the broker will advertise to clients.
# If not set, it uses the value for "listeners".
#advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://your.host.name:9092
listeners=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9094

# Maps listener names to security protocols, the default is for them to be the same. See the config documentation for more details
#listener.security.protocol.map=PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,SSL:SSL,SASL_PLAINTEXT:SASL_PLAINTEXT,SASL_SSL:SASL_SSL

# The number of threads that the server uses for receiving requests from the network and sending responses to the network
num.network.threads=3

# The number of threads that the server uses for processing requests, which may include disk I/O
num.io.threads=8

# The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server
socket.send.buffer.bytes=102400

# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=102400

# The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)
socket.request.max.bytes=104857600


############################# Log Basics #############################

# A comma separated list of directories under which to store log files
log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs-3

# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across
# the brokers.
num.partitions=1

# The number of threads per data directory to be used for log recovery at startup and flushing at shutdown.
# This value is recommended to be increased for installations with data dirs located in RAID array.
num.recovery.threads.per.data.dir=1

############################# Internal Topic Settings  #############################
# The replication factor for the group metadata internal topics "__consumer_offsets" and "__transaction_state"
# For anything other than development testing, a value greater than 1 is recommended to ensure availability such as 3.
offsets.topic.replication.factor=1
transaction.state.log.replication.factor=1
transaction.state.log.min.isr=1

############################# Log Flush Policy #############################

# Messages are immediately written to the filesystem but by default we only fsync() to sync
# the OS cache lazily. The following configurations control the flush of data to disk.
# There are a few important trade-offs here:
#    1. Durability: Unflushed data may be lost if you are not using replication.
#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to excessive seeks.
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
#log.flush.interval.messages=10000

# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
#log.flush.interval.ms=1000

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion due to age
log.retention.hours=168

# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log unless the remaining
# segments drop below log.retention.bytes. Functions independently of log.retention.hours.
#log.retention.bytes=1073741824

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
#log.segment.bytes=1073741824

# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according
# to the retention policies
log.retention.check.interval.ms=300000

############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.
zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181,localhost:2182,localhost:2183

# Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=18000


############################# Group Coordinator Settings #############################

# The following configuration specifies the time, in milliseconds, that the GroupCoordinator will delay the initial consumer rebalance.
# The rebalance will be further delayed by the value of group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms as new members join the group, up to a maximum of max.poll.interval.ms.
# The default value for this is 3 seconds.
# We override this to 0 here as it makes for a better out-of-the-box experience for development and testing.
# However, in production environments the default value of 3 seconds is more suitable as this will help to avoid unnecessary, and potentially expensive, rebalances during application startup.
group.initial.rebalance.delay.ms=0

command to create topic 

got to any of kafka folder ,

stay outside bin folder, dont enter becz, will use /bin to creat topic

use below command
=>
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic Email-PN-Queue --partitions 3 --replication-factor 3 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092, localhost:9093, localhost:9094


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

command to check status of zookeeper

echo stat | nc localhost 2181


//stat is 4 letter word  which we defined in zookeeper configuration , ill give reference go to the topic at line number 48 ::: 4lw.commands.whitelist=*

command to check whther  Kafka brokers register to zookeeper

echo dump | nc localhost 2181 | grep brokers


bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --topic Email-PN-Queue

RUN Zookeeper

./zkServer.sh start

RUN Kafka::

./bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

./bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties // I dont know what this command does
